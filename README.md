## Overview
   - The program receives two numbers in string number format and checks that they are in a valid format using **`isNumber(String a)`** function.  
   - It later calculates the sum and product of the two numbers and displays the results in the base that was given by the user (between 2 and 16) using **`int2Number(int num, int base)`**  function.  
   - After that, the program finds the largest number of the two numbers and the results of the sum and product using **`maxIndex(String[] arr)`** and **`number2Int(String num)`** functions , and displays it in the given base in the number format.  
   - The program runs until the user enters the word "quit", which means the program is terminated.
